# QA puzzle

Hey there, future QA superheroes! Are you ready to dive into the exciting world of testing, debugging and many more? Get ready to flex those testing muscles and put your bug-busting skills to the test, because we've got a thrilling task lined up for you.

## What have we prepared for you?

Get your strategy hat on and prepare for an exhilarating battle of wits and cards. Here's guide to navigating this exciting game:

**Player Duels:** It's a two-player showdown! Each player starts with 20 points of health. Your mission? Outsmart your opponent and reduce their health to 0!

**Deck Power:** Each player gets its own deck of 25 cards.

**Starting Hand:** Both players draw 6 cards from deck at the beginning of the game.

**Draw Power:** On the start of the player's turn the player draws 1 card from the deck.

**End of Turn:** Turn finishes when the player chooses to end it, when the player's hand is empty, or when the player attacks his opponent (player can only attack once per turn with one Attack Card).

**Farewell, Card:** Every card vanishes from the player's hand after it's used.

**Victory or Defeat:** There are only two ways this game can end. Either one player loses all its health points, or someone finds themselves with no cards left to play (no cards in both deck and hand).

**Types of cards in this game:**

1. _**Protect Card (index 1) :**_ _When a player is under attack, the player can use this card at the beginning of its turn to dodge the bullet and keep its health intact._
2. _**Boost Attack Card (index 2) :**_ _When played it adds 3 additional attack damage during turn in which is played (this is only boost for Attack Card, player can not attack with this)_
3. _**Attack Card (index 3-7) :**_ _Attacks a player's opponent by the amount of damage equal to the index of the card._  **Special ability of Attack Card :**  _If a player is attacked by the amount of damage that is equal to one of its own Attack Cards, player can play one of those cards at the beginning of its turn to dodge the bullet and keep its health intact (Note: After using special ability of attack card player gets to play his own turn. Opponent can not be attacked with the same card which special ability is used for deflecting the attack)._

## What do we want from you to do?

Like nothing is perfect, every piece of code is more or less likely to have some bugs (like one you will be provided withâ€¦ It has been written in a bit of a hurry before summer vacation. Sorry!). Responsibility of every developer and especially QA engineers is to minimize the probability that some code has bugs. It is known that the later the phase of development is, the more expensive fixing a bug becomes. It would be perfect if we could find all bugs before any execution testing. So let's try to do that!

## **TASK DESCRIPTION**

1. Write thorough TDS for this card game. What is TDS? **Test Design Specification** (TDS) is a document that outlines the detailed design of test cases and testing procedures. This document typically describes the specific inputs, expected outputs, and steps for executing tests. It helps ensure that testing is systematic and thorough. Examples: _Player takes damage by 6 -\> Player's health decreases by 6. Player draws a card -\> Number of cards in deck decreases._ Be sure to cover all edge cases and all possible scenarios! Also, if there are some open questions you have, write them down and make reasonable assumptions. Write tast cases in provided TDS document.

  Note: This step is probably the most important one! Bad TDS = bugs in production

2. Now that you are finished with making the best possible TDS it's time to write some **Unit Tests**! If your TDS is detailed enough it should be easy for you to cover the code with Unit Test in order to make sure there are no bugs in this game. One example of one Unit Test can be found in class _TestPlayer.java_ in the package _test_ (it tests method _takeDamage_ from class _Player_).

3. Now that you covered your code with Unit Test some might have failed. Oh well, as we expected our code has some bugs. Give your best and find all the bugs and fix them! Write down each bug you found in Bugs document and describe each bug - what is the bug and how you fixed it.

Note: Be aware! Not all bugs can be detected with Unit Tests.

**Pro Tip** : Sometimes original methods and functionalities are too time demanding while testing and searching for bugs. So, you can write some fake methods (we call them _test commands_) in order to make your testing go faster! If you decide to use them make sure to leave them in code (start the name of that function with prefix _testCommand_) so we can see all the great test commands you came up with ðŸ˜€
